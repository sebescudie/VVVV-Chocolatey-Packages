VVVV-Chocolatey-Packages
========================

VVVV, addonpack and some plugins ~~(in the future)~~ packages for [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org). *(Chocolatey is a package manager, apt-get for Windows)*

##How to use it :

If you don't have Chocolatey installed, just go to http://chocolatey.org for instructions. It will take about 2 minutes to install.

When Chocolatey is installed, type `cinst vvvv` and `cinst vvvv-addonpack` in command prompt to install vvvv and addons. I recommend run all commands as administrator.

_By default, all stuff is installing to `C:\vvvv\version` folder. For me it's ok, but i think some people want to specify default installation dirrectory. I will add this functionality in future packages or maybe someone can help me with this and fork my repo._
